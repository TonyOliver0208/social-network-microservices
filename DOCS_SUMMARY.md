## Removed Files (Redundant) ❌

These files were **consolidated** into the above 4 docs:

1. ❌ `PROTO_GENERATION.md` → Merged into `PROTO.md`
2. ❌ `PROTO_GENERATOR_DECISION.md` → Merged into `PROTO.md`
3. ❌ `PROTO_SETUP_COMPLETE.md` → Merged into `CHANGELOG.md`
4. ❌ `PROTOCOL_ANALYSIS.md` → Merged into `ARCHITECTURE.md`
5. ❌ `GATEWAY_ANALYSIS.md` → Merged into `ARCHITECTURE.md`

## Documentation Principles

Each documentation file follows these principles:

✅ **Single Responsibility** - Each doc handles one specific role  
✅ **No Duplication** - Information appears in only one place  
✅ **Clear Purpose** - Easy to know which doc to read  
✅ **Concise** - Only essential information  
✅ **Cross-Referenced** - Links to related docs  

---

## Quick Reference

**Need to...**

- 🚀 **Get started?** → Read `README.md`
- 🏗️ **Understand architecture?** → Read `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- 🔧 **Work with proto files?** → Read `PROTO.md`
- 📜 **See what changed?** → Read `CHANGELOG.md`

---

## Before vs After

### Before ❌
```
15+ documentation files
- Multiple proto-related docs (confusing)
- Redundant architecture docs
- Analysis files with duplicate info
- No clear structure
```

### After ✅
```
4 focused documentation files
- README.md (quick start)
- ARCHITECTURE.md (system design)
- PROTO.md (proto generation)
- CHANGELOG.md (history)
```
